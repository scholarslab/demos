# Credits

*Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning* was created by the University of Virginia’s 2018-2019 Praxis cohort. The [Praxis Program](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/) is housed within [UVa’s Scholars’ Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/), one of the university’s hubs of digital humanities. Each year, the Scholars’ Lab funds six doctoral students from across the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences to serve as Praxis Fellows for the academic year. During the fall semester, Fellows receive immersive training in digital methods and tools as well as in collaborative project management. During the spring semester, Fellows conceive, design, build, and publish a digital project. This year, the Scholars’ Lab charged the Praxis team with creating a digital project “reintroducing” the public domain.


The 2018–2019 [Praxis][1] Fellows are:
- [Catherine Addington][2], who worked on the [typeface](http://unclosure.scholarslab.org/texts/Typeface/) and [translation](http://unclosure.scholarslab.org/texts/Teaching%20Translation%20with%20the%20Public%20Domain/)
- [Zhiqiu (Cho) Jiang][3], who worked on [text mining]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/q-text-mining/)
- [Emily Mellen][4], who worked on [sound]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/sound/) and [translation]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/Italian_translation/)
- [Eleanore Neumann][5], who worked on the [storymap]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/storymap/)
- [Mathilda Shepard][6], who worked on the [website]({{ site.baseurl }}/) and the [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/About/)
- [Chris Whitehead][7], who worked on translation, annotation*, and the [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/About)

The [Praxis Program][8] is a project of the [Scholars’ Lab][9] at the [University of Virginia Library][10].

- [Shawna Ross][41] and her students at TAMU for their feedback on our project framing
- [Brad Rittenhouse][42] and the [DH fellows][43] at Georgia Tech for their perspective early on in the process

We also thank those who assisted with each intervention. In addition to those mentioned above, we extend our gratitude to

*Denotes a project that the Praxis Fellows presented at "Decolonizing the Digital Humanities: Indigenous Arts, Histories, and Knowledges from the Material to the Screen" (Charlottesville, VA. April 6, 2019), but decided not to publish on this site. Please consult the [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/About/) for a discussion about this decision.

This site was built using the [Ed.][46] theme for [Jekyll][47]. The "unlock" icon was designed by [Freepik][48] from [Flaticon][49].
