# Project Narrative

On January 1, 2019, material published in the United States in 1923 [entered the public domain](https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/) after a twenty-year delay due to the extension of copyright terms by Congress. Among the many works of art, film, literature, and music from 1923 newly released into the public domain is Robert Frost’s _New Hampshire_, the collection of poetry that won him a Pulitzer Prize the following year.

Using _New Hampshire_ as our raw material, _Unclosure_ seeks to explore the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. On this website, you can view a series of projects based on material from _New Hampshire_, each accompanied by a tutorial that will walk you through the copyright rules and digital tools you would need to replicate or remix the project on your own. As we believe that the cultural commons should be protected and expanded, we hope this exploration will empower scholars, teachers, and members of the general public to engage the variety of public-domain material now widely available online.

# Why Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning?
Our project title plays on the English [enclosure][1] movement, which fenced off common land for private use. Many scholars, including [James Boyle][2], have referred to the extension of U.S. copyright terms as a “Second Enclosure Movement,” which similarly fences off intellectual property as private, at the expense of the cultural commons. As legal academics “continue to debate the wisdom and extent of cultural enclosure” (Lewis Hyde, “The Enclosure of Culture” 57), we pause to celebrate this moment of (un)closure, in which individual intellectual property rights over the 1923 corpus have been dissolved and the works opened up for public use.

In addition to celebration, this project seeks to inform the general public about their rights to public-domain works. As we see it, the cultural commons is increasingly enclosed not just by expanded copyright terms, but by a lack of awareness around copyright law. By providing both legal and logistical tutorials for each of our projects, we aim to empower students, teachers, scholars, and creators to participate in the public domain—and to release their own works back into it.

Our subtitle, “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning,” is taken from the title of the 1710 law now known as the [Statute of Anne][3], which first subjected copyright to government regulation. This phrase reflects “the primary objective of copyright law,” which “is not to reward the author, but rather to secure for the public the benefits derived from the authors’ labors” (H. R. Rep. No. 100–609, p. 22, 1988, [cited by J. Breyer here][4]).

When a work is released into the public domain, it is by no means certain that the public will in fact have access to “the benefits derived from the authors’ labors.” Though organizations like [Google Books][5] and [HathiTrust][6] have made large-scale efforts to provide online access to newly public-domain works, plenty of other public domain works remain undigitized. In addition, many public-domain works are hidden behind paywalls or buried in proprietary databases—such as the government documents digitized by LexisNexis—such that nominally “free” works are not meaningfully free at all. Without diminishing the monetary and cultural value added to these free works by such information structures, _Unclosure_ envisions a cultural commons enriched by direct access to public domain works in digital space.

# Why _New Hampshire_?
Of all the works published in 1923 that were newly released into the public domain on January 1, 2019, we chose to work with Robert Frost’s poetry collection _New Hampshire_ both because the text’s history is well suited to a project on the public domain and for straightforward practical reasons.

On the practical side of things, the collection is so well known that we knew we could rely on major digital archives like [Project Gutenberg][7] and [HathiTrust][8] to provide immediate access to the work once it was in the public domain. As such, we would have a complete digital edition to work from as a starting point for our own project. Similarly, the work’s fame meant that we felt free from the obligation to make an intervention from a literary studies perspective, instead focusing our efforts on public-domain awareness. In addition, _New Hampshire_ provides raw material at a scale that accommodates a variety of DH projects: it can be studied at the level of the character (typeface), short poem (translation), long poem (annotation), or even the whole collection (text mining).

Most crucially, however, the collection has a rather emblematic history when it comes to copyright and the public domain. Frost himself certainly engaged the cultural commons—for instance, his inclusion of “Notes” and “Grace Notes” sections in _New Hampshire_ parodies the Notes section of T.S. Eliot’s _The Waste Land_, published the previous year in 1922 (_The Robert Frost Encyclopedia_ 230). Long after the author’s death, _New Hampshire_’s copyright was vigorously defended by Frost’s estate and publisher, Henry Holt Inc., which [famously shut down][9] composer Eric Whitacre’s choral work set to the collection’s most famous poem, “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” All the while, that poem [has circulated widely][10] through American culture, from English textbooks to John F. Kennedy’s campaign speeches. Now, it is entirely free to read, reuse, and reinterpret. To us, _New Hampshire_  exemplifies the life cycle of cultural production: even if it is codified in law as intellectual property for a time, it begins and ends with the commons.

Things to add:
- Address up front in the project narrative the fact that Robert Frost doesn’t have positive connotations for most Abenaki people (cf. conversation w/Siobhan Senier). Like even if you don’t do “Vanishing Red” you have to address it in your introduction.
- Lankes’ woodcuts present an uninhabited landscape so always make sure to present the image critically. (Use Francis Jennings’ idea of New England as “virgin land” vs. “widowed land”?)
- Playing around with idea of “domain” (etymology of dominion), coming from physical space, and our project is about physical space (NH, maps) in a way.
- As we wrote in our [project charter][11], we seek to think critically about the “public domain”:
	- Public: which public? Who benefits from accessibility? Who is harmed? Also, something about being funded/hosted by a public institution
	- Domain: something abt colonialism
	- What resources are needed to access this project? Can we reduce those barriers? Should we?
- Address project sustainability: questions will stand, but tools / even law will change
