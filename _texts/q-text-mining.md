Through different ways to explore the materials, this data mining intervention seeks a better understanding about *The New Hampshire* as well as public domain legal documents by using text mining tools. 

## **Data mining**

While conceding that the paradigm of ‘open data’, coupled with other developments such as the Internet of Things, data mining and deep learning, indeed gives rise to changed sociotechnical formations, building on arguments made in connection with the proposal for a ‘open computing’ for humanities in the digital age.

## **The New Hampshire corpus**
The New Hampshire corpus provides easy access to a collection of the book. Through “reading” the individual poems, the analysis enables us to uncover the untold stories of the literature.

#### Word Contexts

The Contexts (or Keywords in Context) tool shows each occurrence of a keyword with a bit of surrounding text (the context). It can be useful for studying more closely how terms are used in different contexts.

Use it with poem *The New Hampshire* to look at the occurence of word 'mountains':

#### Cirrus
Cirrus is a word cloud that visualizes the top frequency words of a corpus or document. The word cloud positions the words such that the terms that occur the most frequently are positioned centrally and are sized the largest. As the algorithm goes through the list and continues to attempt to draw words as close as possible to the center of the visualization it will also include small words within spaces left by larger words that do not fit together snugly. It's important to understand that the colour of words and their absolute position are not significant (if you resize the window or reload the page, words may appear in a different location).
