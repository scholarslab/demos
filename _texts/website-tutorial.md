title: Building The Website
---

[Minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) principles guided web development for the *Unclosure* project. In the spirit of the public domain, we wanted our website to be as open and accessible as possible. Because static sites load well in low-connectivity environments and are easy to host accross a variety of platforms, we generated a static site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Ed.](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) theme designed by [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex/ed). Static sites are free to host on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and do not depend on complicated databases, content managment systems or proprietary software. You could even use [No-Connect](https://github.com/xpmethod/no-connect) to serve your jekyll site on a USB drive for offline distribution through the [sneakernet](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sneakernet). 

[Amanda Visconti's](http://amandavisconti.com/) static site [tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) on [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) provides an excellent step-by-step guide for setting up your own Jekyll site. You can also consult the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), [tutorials](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/home/) and [ProfHacker's](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker) two-part [article] (https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913) for more help building and understanding static websites.
