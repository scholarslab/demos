## II. Nd’awighonanob lintowôganiz, "We wrote it/ the little song (poem)"<br/>

First, Chris attempted translating “Plowmen” into Western Abenaki:<br/>

**nodkazôwadjik**<br/>	
people whose profession or specialty is cutting and throwing earth<br/>
_Plowmen_<br/>

**wd’idambok/ wd’awakakto/ lakazôwôgan/ waji/ ‘lakazôwa/ wazôlia.**<br/>
they say something/ she uses something/ a plow/ in order to/ she plows (cuts and throws) someone/ snow<br/>
_A plow, they say, to plow the snow._<br/>

**adagigen/ wd’idamenô/ wd’akika/ wazôlia**<br/>
it is doubtful/ that they say/ she plants someone/ snow<br/>
_They cannot mean to plant it, no—_<br/>

**aiaga/ w’mamesanôbdalemôwô**<br/> 
unless/ they laugh at her with scorn<br/>
_Unless in bitterness to mock_<br/>
aiaga = unless, if not

**wzômi/ ‘lakahoji/ senal**<br/>
because/ she will dig something, hoe something/ stones<br/>
_At having cultivated rock._<br/>

<br/>
Next, Chris posted his initial translation to the Western Abenaki-Abénaquis de l'Ouest Facebook group, soliciting feedback:<br/>

>Kwai nidôbak (Hello/ friends)! I was wondering if any of you would like to help with a project that I am working on with some colleagues at the University of Virginia. We are making a website to demonstrate the ways that people can use materials in the public domain, using Robert Frost’s 1923 book New Hampshire as a case study. Among the many things people can do with materials in the public domain is translate them and post them online for others to enjoy free of charge. Since Frost’s New Hampshire takes place in Abenaki country, I thought I would put my own learning to the test and try translating one of his poems into Abenaki. I selected the poem “Plowmen” because I thought it illuminates the fundamentally different worldview the Abenaki language reveals about working the earth than the sort of farming Frost describes. It was a challenge and a lot of fun. That said, I am at the beginning of my journey learning Abenaki and am sure I made many, many mistakes. Would any of you like to help? I’d appreciate feedback of any variety: edits, suggestions for alternative words, corrections to conjugations, different ways of breaking down the original poem…or telling me I’m flat-out wrong! Of course, anyone who wishes to participate will be credited on the website once the project is finished.

<br/>
Eric Brier replied, offering a much more nuanced translation. Eric is an experienced speaker, and was generous in sharing his time and knowledge:

>I might offer this as an alternative while we wait for the others, I tried to keep to your general structure as I don't know enough about the poem to know what is going on. I also tried to get it to have kind of rhyming scheme in both languages. Taking a few liberties with English. This isn't a proper reflection of poetry in Abenaki, that is something I am very bad at and currently trying to learn more about. It is important to note that because our ancestors had a great way with these words, and one that I have yet to attain, and I will not paint a picture as an expert in that regard.

Chris followed up with Eric, asking clarifying questions about his translations:<br/>

>Wliwni mina (thank you/ again), Eric! I worked through the translations you offered - they were very helpful! Could I ask a few questions about some of the conjugations, to make sure I am learning from this exercise? No rush in answering these questions -- you have already been very generous with your time!

1. In the first line, why do you include the "w' " before "kizawakakto"? As I understand it, the verb is Transitive Inanimate with a corresponding Indefinite Object. From the pattern I can discern from Laurent's example conjugations, the Transitive Inanimate with Indefinite Object does not take a "w' " at the beginning (unless the verb begins with a vowel, in which case it takes "wd' "). Is that correct? If so, does the prefix "kiz-" change something?

2. In the first line, could you please explain the conjugation of "lakahôd," specifically the ending "ôd"? Looking at the Gordon Day dictionary, I've seen that other words with similar endings are designated as "TA pt," Transitive Animate participles. Is that correct? Would the TA pt form be necessary because it follows "kizi," rendering "kizi lakahôd" a compound verb?

3. Could you please explain the formation of mamessanimogôhôditji in the third line? I see that "mamessanim" comes from the verb mamessanimômek, "one ridicules someone." I believe that the ending "ji" renders the verb into future tense. However, I haven't been able to figure out the significance of "ogôhôdit."

<br/>
Eric answered Chris's questions, explaining in detail how the Western Abenaki language works:
>Sure, no problem.

1. So when you don't have w(d)'- it's because there is no relation between the doer and anything else. It just is "s/he  ...s in general" nodam = s/he hears; liwizo = she is called, etc. Here "awakakto lakahigan" sounds more like a command: "You, use a hoe!" Wd'awakakto = s/he uses something; awakakto = s/he uses (in general)/"use it!". kiz- as a preverb just means "able to". "W'kizawakakto lakahigan" = s/he is able to use something: a hoe. 

2. Sure, I've never seen (but this doesn't mean it doesn't/can't happen) where the construction of "waji kizi" (in order to, to be able to) doesn't take a conjunct verb after it. "Waji kizi laka-hô-d" = in order that he(central)-hoes-him(obviate) (Wazôli-a being na/nihi and taking animate verbs). So you will see -ô-d = "that-he-VERBS-him."

3. I'm pretty sure I said that I am not 100% certain on this one, however, allow me to explain it anyways:Mamessanim-egw-ôhôdit is: Ridicule-obivate.acts.on.central-him-them. "That they ridicule him". The -ôhôdit is often a "That they (3rd pers.plural) VERB him/them". Perhaps -egw- isn't needed, and you can just skip right to mamessanimôhôdit, which might be a safer, although potentially more ambiguous, construction. Some speakers will write the intervocalic -h-, to wit an -h- between any two consecutive vowels a-h-a, ô-h-ô, i-h-i, etc; some speakers will not write these h’s (aa, ôô, ii). It doesn't make a difference really if you write it or not, as it is pronounced therewith (from what I've heard). Therefore, ôôdit and ôhôdit are the same suffix.

<br/>
Using Eric's explanations, Chris made minor edits to the final version of the translation, presented above in section I.

## III. Emily's reflections on language and translation<br/>
Emily Melen

My first obstacle in making this translation was the poem’s premise. Frost builds his poem of off the name of the machine we call a snow plow. The poem is a joke about the relationship of a snow plow to the regular work of plowing in New England. In Italian a snow plow is called a spazzaneve or “snow sweeper,” rather than using the word plow, or “aratro.” I decided, however, to use only words related to plowing in order to make clear the meaning of the poem if one knows the concept and how it relates to English. This maintains the poem’s relationship to its original language and to the context in which it was born, while (I hope) rendering it legible to an Italian-speaking reader. 

My next task, to literally translate each of the words of the poem, was not very difficult because of the relationship between English and Italian. That is to say, that most English words have a direct Italian equivalent. For example, the word bitterness is used in a metaphorical sense in English. Bitterness refers directly to a taste of food, but it also refers to a feeling of resentment and sadness at the conclusion of a situation. In this case, I believe that the bitterness Frost refers to is the bitterness of a New Hampshire farmer who has to contend with constantly rocky soil. This double sense of bitterness is shared in Italian, as is the knowledge of frustration with rocky soil, which is also a reality of the farmer in less fertile parts of Italy. The most important shared concept in the poem is the idea of plowing the land itself, which relies on a tradition of European agriculture that would presumably not exist in languages that do not use this particular tool or method.

After a literal translation of the poem, I went back in order to try to make the poem rhyme and to sound like a poem in Italian. I should add a very very very large caveat that I know next to nothing about Italian poetry or poetry in general. I do know, however, from reading Italian poetry and songs, that they tend to drop the final “-e” on verbs, especially when they fall at the end of phrases. So, “arare” becomes “arar” and “piantare” becomes “piantar.” I also know that there is flexibility in the order of verb and object, so in order to find a rhyme, I made the line “Un aratro, dicono, per arare la neve” (A plow, they say, for plowing the snow) into “Un aratro, dicono, per la neve arar” (A plow, they say, for the snow to plow) and the line “Non è possibile che intendono piantarla peró” (It’s not possible that they mean to plant it, though) into “Ma non è possibile che la intendono piantar” (But it’s not possible that they mean it to plant). 

The second couplet was a little trickier. I understand the joke of the final couplet to be that farming in New England is like plowing rock. So, I took it as important that the final word was “rock,” which serves as a sort of punchline, and gives a comical, bitter tone to the entire poem. My original literal translation of the entire couplet was:

> Se non per amarezza deridere<br/>
> L’aver coltivato la pietra<br/>

This is pretty literal. The only word I waffled on was using “per amarezza” (for bitterness) or “in amarezza” (in bitterness). Although “in” was more literal, I thought “per” was necessary to communicate the sense of “in order to” that the “to” in “to mock” gets across. 

Because I didn’t want to move the word “pietra” around, I first tried to find all the other words I could think of that could also mean rock. There are a lot, but this didn’t work, because none of them contained an ending that rhymed with deridere. In fact, this would be unlikely because this kind of ending is almost always for verbs. Also, as a note, I intuitively decided not to change “deridere” to “derider” because of the emphasis. Whereas “arare” and “piantare” both hold their emphasis on the penultimate syllable (aRAre, pianTARe) and dropping the final “e” has no effect, I feel that with deridere, in which the emphasis is on the antipenultimate syllable (deRIdere), dropping the final “e” would make it seem like “deriDER,” which is confusing and incorrect. Again, I’m not an expert and I have no idea if this intuition is correct or what grammatical rules it’s based on, but that was my reasoning.

After trying my list of rock names and realizing they wouldn’t work, I started thinking of synonyms for the word “mock,” but before I got very far into this, it occured to me that I could also move “amarezza” to the end by changing the line to “Se non per deridere in amarezza,” which left me with the very common word ending “-ezza” (roughly, -ness) to rhyme. Then, I realized I could add the adjective “grezza” (course, rough) to the end of my final line, which keeps the placement of the word “pietra” and only deepens the meaning slightly, in a way that I feel is consistent with the mood of the poem.

The last part of my translation was to try to think about the meter of the poem. Again, I know nothing about poetic meter, so I asked for help from my brilliant colleague Catherine Addington, who advised that English use of stress probably does not have an easy equivalent in Italian. As long as none of my lines were awkwardly long, the poem’s sense of meter was probably fine, she advised. Through reading the translation out loud several times, I determined that I could easily read it in a way in which all the lines lasted equivalently long, which I, as a music scholar, of course measure in 4/4 time. This is almost certainly an imperfect method for incorporating meter and could doubtlessly be improved upon by someone who knows more about poetry, but I hope it will be helpful.
 






Part II: Translation in Teaching (Catherine, Spanish; Emily, Italian)
Empower others to do the same task
Teaching translation not as a way to produce good Spanish/lo que sea translations but rather as a point to demonstrate what is lost in translation, what you have to prioritize, teaching students how to isolate elements of rhetorical style (rhyming, puns, diction) and consider them in two languages. What is specific to each language, what works in both, what is most important to preserve, what are you willing to sacrifice?
Using a short poem that has simple diction (easy to translate) but difficult structure (rhyme, iambic tetrameter, pun: plowing the earth, snow-plowing are not the same in other languages) is a good way to teach students about the difficulties of translation, the priorities you need to set. Rhyme, meter, and wordplay are the primary challenges when it comes to translation and depending on the poem they may have varying levels of importance to the poem’s meaning.
First you have to understand / analyze the poem.
Meaning: it’s a joke based on the shared use of “plow” for plowing the earth (digging deep and planting) and plowing snow (clearing it away). New Hampshire soil is rocky, so you wouldn’t plant snow in it except as a joke.
Rhyme: consonant (i.e. both vowels and consonant endings rhyme)
Meter: iambic tetrameter
Wordplay: plow (the earth) / (snow)plow
Then you rank your priorities. Which elements are essential for the translation? Given that it’s a short joke poem about rocky New Hampshire soil, to what extent are we comfortable preserving a certain foreignness/localness in our translations?
