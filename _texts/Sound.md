I staid the night for shelter at a farm <br/>
 Behind the mountains, with a mother and son,<br/>
 Two old-believers. They did all the talking.<br/>

 *Mother.* Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits<br/>
 She could call up to pass a winter evening,<br/>
 But won't, should be burned at the stake or something.<br/>
 Summoning spirits isn't "Button, button,<br/>
 Who's got the button," I would have them know.<br/>
 </span>
<br/>
 *Son.* Mother can make a common table rear<br/>
 And kick with two legs like an army mule.<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* And when I've done it, what good have I
 done? <br/>
 Rather than tip a table for you, let me <br/>
 Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.<br/>
 He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him <br/>
 How could that be -- I thought the dead were souls,<br/>
 He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious<br/>
 That there's something the dead are keeping back?<br/>
 Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back.<br/>
<br/>
 *Son.* You wouldn't want to tell him what we have
 Up attic, mother?<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* Bones -- a skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
 *Son.* But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed<br/>
 Against the' attic door: the door is nailed.<br/>
 It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night<br/>
 Halting perplexed behind the barrier<br/>
 Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get<br/>
 Is back into the cellar where it came from.<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* We'll never let them, will we, son? We'll
 never!<br/>
<br/>
 *Son.* It left the cellar forty years ago<br/>
 And carried itself like a pile of dishes<br/>
 Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen,<br/>
 Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,<br/>
 Another from the bedroom to the attic,<br/>
 Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped
 it.<br/>
 Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.<br/>
 I was a baby: I don't know where I was.<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* The only fault my husband found with me -- <br/>
 I went to sleep before I went to bed,<br/>
 Especially in winter when the bed<br/>
 Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.<br/>
 The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs<br/>
 Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,<br/>
 But left an open door to cool the room off<br/>
 So as to sort of turn me out of it.<br/>
 I was just coming to myself enough<br/>
 To wonder where the cold was coming from,<br/>
 When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom<br/>
 And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.<br/>
 The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on<br/>
 When there was water in the cellar in spring<br/>
 Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone<br/>
 Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,<br/>
 The way a man with one leg and a crutch,<br/>
 Or a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:<br/>
 It wasn't anyone who could be there.<br/>
 The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked<br/>
 And swollen tight and buried under snow.<br/>
 The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust<br/>
 And swollen tight and buried under snow.<br/>
 It was the bones. I knew them -- and good reason.<br/>
 My first impulse was to get to the knob<br/>
 And hold the door. But the bones didn't try<br/>
 The door; they halted helpless on the landing,<br/>
 Waiting for things to happen in their favor.<br/>
 The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.<br/>
 I never could have done the thing I did<br/>
 If the wish hadn't been too strong in me<br/>
 To see how they were mounted for this walk.<br/>
 I had a vision of them put together<br/>
 Not like a man, but like a chandelier.<br/>
 So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.<br/>
 A moment he stood balancing with emotion,<br/>
 And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire<br/>
 Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.<br/>
 Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)<br/>
 Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,<br/>
 The way he did in life once; but this time<br/>
 I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,<br/>
 And fell back from him on the floor myself.<br/>
 The finger-pieces slid in all directions.<br/>
 (Where did I see one of those pieces lately? <br/>
 Hand me my button-box- it must be there.)<br/>
 I sat up on the floor and shouted, "Toffile,<br/>
 It's coming up to you." It had its choice<br/>
 Of the door to the cellar or the hall.<br/>
 It took the hall door for the novelty,<br/>
 And set off briskly for so slow a thing,<br/>
 Still going every which way in the joints, though,<br/>
 So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,<br/>
 From the slap I had just now given its hand. <br/>
 I listened till it almost climbed the stairs<br/>
 From the hall to the only finished bedroom,<br/>
 Before I got up to do anything;<br/>
 Then ran and shouted, "Shut the bedroom door,<br/>
 Toffile, for my sake!" "Company," he said,<br/>
 "Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed."<br/>
 So lying forward weakly on the handrail<br/>
 I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light<br/>
 (The kitchen had been dark) I had to own<br/>
 I could see nothing. "Toffile, I don't see it.<br/>
 It's with us in the room though. It's the bones."<br/>
 "What bones?" "The cellar bones -- out of the 
 grave." <br/>
 That made him throw his bare legs out of bed <br/>
 And sit up by me and take hold of me. <br/>
 I wanted to put out the light and see <br/>
 If I could see it, or else mow the room, <br/>
 With our arms at the level of our knees, <br/>
 And bring the chalk-pile down. "I'll tell you what --<br/>
 It's looking for another door to try. <br/>
 The uncommonly deep snow has made him think <br/>
 Of his old song, *The Wild Colonial Boy*,<br/>
 He always used to sing along the tote-road.<br/>
 He's after an open door to get out-doors.<br/>
 Let's trap him with an open door up attic." <br/>
 Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,<br/>
 Almost the moment he was given an opening,<br/>
 The steps began to climb the attic stairs.<br/>
 I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.<br/>
 "Quick!" I slammed to the door and held the knob.<br/>
 "Toffile, get nails." I made him nail the door shut,<br/>
 And push the headboard of the bed against it.<br/>
 Then we asked was there anything<br/>
 Up attic that we'd ever want again.<br/>
 The attic was less to us than the cellar.<br/>
 If the bones liked the attic, let them have it.<br/>
 Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes<br/>
 Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed<br/>
 Behind the door and headboard of the bed,<br/>
 Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,<br/>
 With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,<br/>
 That's what I sit up in the dark to say --<br/>
 To no one any more since Toffile died.<br/>
 Let them stay in the attic since they went there.<br/>
 I promised Toffile to be cruel to them<br/>
 For helping them be cruel once to him.<br/>
<br/>
 *Son.* We think they had a grave down in the cellar.<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* We know they had a grave down in the cellar.<br/>
<br/>
 *Son.* We never could find out whose bones they were.<br/>
<br/>
 *Mother.* Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for 
 once.<br/>
 They were a man's his father killed for me.<br/>
 I mean a man he killed instead of me.<br/>
 The least I could do was to help dig their grave.<br/>
 We were about it one night in the cellar.<br/>
 Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him<br/>
 To tell the truth, suppose the time had come.<br/>
 Son looks surprised to see me end a lie <br/>
 We'd kept all these years between ourselves <br/>
 So as to have it ready for outsiders. <br/>
 But tonight I don't care enough to lie -- <br/>
 I don't remember why I ever cared. <br/>
 Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe <br/>
 Could tell you why he ever cared himself... <br/>
<br/>
 She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted <br/>
 Among the buttons poured out in her lap. <br/>
 I verified the name next morning: Toffile. <br/>
 The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway. <br/>
