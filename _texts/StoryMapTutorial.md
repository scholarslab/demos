# How to Make a StoryMap
by Eleanore Neumann

A storymap is exactly what is sounds like: a digital storytelling tool that pairs text with a map in a progressive narrative that often includes additional multimedia. If you would like to learn how to make one like "Mapping New Hampshire," follow the steps below.

**1. Choose the right platform for your storymap**

Many different storymap tools are now available online, so it is impportant to choose one that is right for your project. You may want to consider whether or not you have the programming skills required by some of the more advanced tools (and if not, then you could always learn!)? Do you want the tool to be closed source or open source? What functions should the storymap perform?

Here are a few tools to get you started along with detail how-to guides:
