"New Hampshire" is the title poem from Robert Frost's collection of poetry <i>New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes</i> (1923). We might assume that Frost only mentiones places within the state of New Hampshire, but this storymap reveals that Frost used places from around the world in order to help him create an imagined geography of New Hampshire.<br><br>

The easiest way to read the storymap is to scroll through the poem using the down arrow while the map spans locations. Mouse over the blue text to see Frost's in-text citations (that link to the "note" or "grace note" originally referenced) or green text to see examples of annotatations (many more of which could be added to this poem).

                <p><span data-place="south">I met a lady from the South who said <br>(You won't believe she said it, but she said it): <br>"None of my family ever worked, or had <br>A thing to sell."</span> I don't suppose the work <br>Much matters. You may work for all of me. <br>I've seen the time I've had to work myself. <br><a href="#noteA">The having anything to sell is what <br>Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.</a></p>
                <p><span data-place="arkansas">I met a traveller from Arkansas <br>Who boasted of his state as beautiful <br>For diamonds and apples.</span> "Diamonds <br>And apples in commercial quantities?" <br>I asked him, on my guard. "Oh yes," he answered, <br>Off his. The time was evening in the <a href="#A1">Pullman</a>. <br>"I see the porter's made your bed," I told him.</p>
                <p><span data-place="california">I met a Californian who would <br>Talk California — a state so blessed, <br>He said, in climate none had ever died there <br>A natural death, and Vigilance Committees <br>Had had to organize to stock the graveyards <br>And vindicate the state's humanity. </span><br><span data-place="britisharctic"><a href="#A2">"Just the way Steffanson runs on," I murmured, <br>"About the British Arctic</a>. That's what comes <br>Of being in the market with a climate."</span></p>

                <p>I met a poet from another state, <br>A zealot full of fluid inspiration, <br>Who in the name of fluid inspiration, <br>But in the best style of bad salesmanship, <br>Angrily tried to make me write a protest <br>(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act. <br>He didn't even offer me a drink <br>Until I asked for one to steady him. <br>This is called having an idea to sell.</p>
                <p><span data-place="newhampshire">It never could have happened in New Hampshire.</span></p>
                <p><span data-place="california">The only person really soiled with trade <br>I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire <br>Was someone who had just come back ashamed <br>From selling things in California. </span><br><span data-place="constantinople">He'd built a noble mansard roof with balls <br>On turrets like Constantinople, deep <br>In woods some ten miles from a railroad station, <br>As if to put forever out of mind <br>The hope of being, as we say, received.</span><br><span data-place="brighton">I found him standing at the close of day <br>Inside the threshold of his open barn, <br>Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage —<br>And recognized him through the iron grey <br>In which his face was muffled to the eyes <br>As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed <br>A drover with me on the road to Brighton.</span><br>His farm was "grounds," and not a farm at all; <br>His house among the local sheds and shanties <br>Rose like a factor's at a trading station. <br>And he was rich, and I was still a rascal. <br>I couldn't keep from asking impolitely, <br>Where had he been and what had he been doing?</p>

                <p>Just specimens is all New Hampshire has, <br>One each of everything as in a show-case <br>Which naturally she doesn't care to sell.</p>
                <p>She had one President (pronounce him Purse, <br>And make the most of it for better or worse. <br>He's your one chance to score against the state). <br>She had one Daniel Webster. He was all <br>The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be. <br><span data-place="dartmouth">She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him.</span></p>
                <p>I call her old. <span data-place="wabanaki">She has one family <br>Whose claim is good to being settled here <br>Before the era of colonization, <br>And before that of exploration even. </span><br><span data-place="isleofshoals">John Smith remarked them as he coasted by <br>Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf <br>At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself <br>They weren't Red Indians but veritable <br>Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people, <br>Like those who furnished Adam's sons with wives; <br>However uninnocent they may have been <br>In being there so early in our history.</span> <br>They'd been there then a hundred years or more. <br>Pity he didn't ask what they were up to <br>At that date with a wharf already built, <br>And take their name. <span data-place="nottingham">They've since told me their name — <br>Today an honored one in Nottingham.</span></p>

            <section>
                <p>As for what they were up to more than fishing — <br>Suppose they weren't behaving Puritanly, <br>The hour had not yet struck for being good, <br>Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical. <br>It became an explorer of the deep <br>Not to explore too deep in others' business.</p>
                <p>Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has <br>One real reformer who would change the world <br>So it would be accepted by two classes, <br>Artists the minute they set up as artists, <br>Before, that is, they are themselves accepted, <br>And boys the minute they get out of college. <br>I can't help thinking those are tests to go by.</p>
                <p><span data-place="philadelphia">And she has one I don't know what to call him, <br>Who comes from Philadelphia every year <br>With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds <br>He wants to give the educational <br>Advantages of growing almost wild <br>Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle — <br>Dorkings because they're spoken of by Chaucer, <br>Sussex because they're spoken of by Herrick.</span></p>
                <p>She has a touch of gold. <a href="#noteB">New Hampshire gold— <br>You may have heard of it.</a> <span data-place="berlin">I had a farm <br>Offered me not long since up Berlin way <br>With a mine on it that was worked for gold; <br>But not gold in commercial quantities.</span> <br>Just enough gold to make the engagement rings <br>And marriage rings of those who owned the farm. <br>What gold more innocent could one have asked for?</p>

                <p>More than enough land for a specimen <br>You'll say she has, but there there enters in <br>Something else to protect her from herself. <br><a href="#noteD">There quality makes up for quantity.</a> <br><span data-place="newhampshire">Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.</span> <br>The farm I made my home on in the mountains <br>I had to take by force rather than buy. <br>I caught the owner outdoors by himself <br>Raking up after winter, and I said, <br>"I'm going to put you off this farm: I want it." <br>"Where are you going to put me?

                <p>Apples?
