Sound Tutorial


As scholars of radio and voice, such as NAME 1 and NAME 2, have noted, hearing words through someone’s voice can produce a kind of intimacy that is not possible with the written word. In particular, while reading (and inevitably reproducing the text in one’s own inner voice) can produce a sense of intimacy with the words, but hearing them can produce a sense of intimacy with the speaker and, in turn, the character or story they embody. In addition audio clips give us a chance to add sound effects (leaves rustling, the sound of a crowd, etc.), which can enliven or bring clarity to the impressions given by the text. It also gives us a chance to demonstrate musical passages or sounds mentioned so that the reader can actually hear these aural references, much like including the image of a painting or photograph discussed in the text.


As a music and sound scholar, I am thrilled at the possibility for digital projects to use sound in this way. There are many forms of technology which allow one to attach sound and audio, but here I am primarily going to discuss SoundCite. SoundCite is a tool which allows you to attach an audio file to a specific part of the text of a webpage, like so. It is created by KnightLab at Northwestern University and as a piece of free, open-source software, it is in keeping with the ethos of accessibility that guides this project. Further instructions for using SoundCite can be found here.


Unfortunately, sound has some of the most complex and controversial copyright restrictions of all. There is currently no public domain for sound, but soon there will be. As of January 1
